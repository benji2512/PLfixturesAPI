# Premier League Fixtures API  
This API will be designed to feed *up to date* fixture details to a webpage and Android/IOS app. I will keep the website and apps in different repos to keep maintainence easy  

It will be built using: 
- OpenFaaS as the provider  
- MongoDB as the database  
- Python as the main language  
  
It will be built over time and I will update the below checklist according to the progress being made and the newer additions I think up.  
TODO list is stored on Joplin for the time being. I will update that regularly and put latest overalls HERE :partying_face:  

Latest Overall Update 26/08/21:  
I have one function live on OpenFaaS and will create a simple react app for the api call test to that. Building on function at a time to make sure I have a correct flow.
